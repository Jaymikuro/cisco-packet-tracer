# cisco-packet-tracer
This Packet Tracer project simulates a basic network topology connecting two branches (Branch 1 and Branch 2) using a central router. Each branch contains multiple PCs, printers, and servers interconnected via switches.

# Key Features
Star Topology within each branch.
Centralized Routing using a single router between branches.
Separation by Subnet:
Branch 1 uses subnet 192.168.1.0/24
Branch 2 uses subnet 129.168.2.0/24

# Objectives
Simulate a real-world inter-branch office network.
Practice IP addressing, device configuration, and connectivity tests.
Demonstrate server-client communication, printing, and basic routing.
Implement DHCP services
